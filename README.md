This is the repository for RsyncVerify, a SwiftUI based macOS application. RsyncVerify is released for *macOS Sonoma and later*. RsyncVerify is a GUI on the Apple macOS platform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize data tasks. The GUI is *only* for organizing tasks, setting parameters to `rsync` and make it easier to use `rsync`.

| Homebrew | macOS versions |   Latest version   |
| ----------- |   ----------- | ----------- |
| `brew install --cask rsyncui`    | macOS Sonoma and later | v2.8.5 - [January 3, 2026](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncVerify/releases) - in *active development* |
| |  | [documentation](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/) and [changelog](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/blog/) |

If you find RsyncVerify useful, I would appreciate it if you could consider giving me a star. Each star serves as motivation for me to continue developing RsyncVerify.

The [user documentation](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/docs/)([repo](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rsyncuidocs)) is based upon a fork of the excellent Hugo based theme [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy). RsyncVerify might be installed by Homebrew or by direct download. It is *signed* and *notarized* by Apple.
